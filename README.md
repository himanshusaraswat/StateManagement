# Vision Books

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.  

## Development server

 - Should have Node JS installed.
   
   Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to
   `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you
   change any of the source files.  

## Build  

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. 

## Running unit tests  

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).  

## Design Strategy  

To solve the statement I could have used 3 approaches:

 1. Prepare a complete MEAN stack app to solve the scenarios

 2. Better would have been Firestore as a DB. Leveraging the power of backend-as-a-service.

 3. In the nick of time & respect to DRY & KISS principle. I chose the below approach.

 4. Mocked the API data from Marvel Comics. (Yeah I love marvel, ;-) ). 
    
    
     - Implemented a single store pattern. Giving a single point to add &       retrieve data.        
    
     - Completely uncluttered code courtesy of the     modular patter I    follow.
